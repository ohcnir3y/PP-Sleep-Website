                    After a night of <strong>poor sleep</strong>, you might have noticed a different feeling. Whether that was wheezy, 
                    uncomfortable, or confused, it most likely wouldn't have been something you want to feel again. 
                    Indeed, poor sleep can significantly and negatively affect our <strong>body, mind, and performance</strong>. 
                    According to William Dement, founder of Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic, <strong>sleep deprivation</strong>
                    "is a big problem. What it means is that nobody performs at the level they could perform." 
                    Additionally, recurring poor sleep can be <strong>punishing</strong>, leading to negative long term effects on your <strong>health</strong>.

                <p>
                    Before we learn about the effects of poor quality sleep, we need to know what <strong>sleep quality</strong> is in the first place. To provide a simple definition, sleep quality means one's satisfaction with sleep experience. It takes into account various factors such as sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, quantity, and refreshment upon awakening. <strong>High-quality sleep</strong> is characterized by effortless transitions (between wakefulness and sleep as well as between sleep stages) and no interruption of sleep.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is <strong>hard to define</strong> good quality sleep objectively, however. Even if polysomnographic recording for an individual shows a typical sleep progress chart, quality of sleep during that night can be defined as poor if the individual was not satisfied. Despite these complications, <strong>sleep assessments</strong> are used to determine the quality of a night or an extended period's sleep. These are three main aspects involved in sleep assessment: amount, quality, and architecture.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are mainly <strong>two types of sleep assessment</strong>: those done post sleep and the survey-type. They have different time frames and each is thus specialized for distinct purposes. <strong>Post sleep assessments</strong> generally reflect more accurately on the night-to-night variations in sleep quality. On the other hand, <strong>survey-type questionnaires</strong> can provide insight on frequency or duration of specific problems. However, both assessment methods have their <strong>limitations</strong>–post sleep assessments do not provide long term insight into issues, and survey-type assessments cannot indicate the severity of the particular problem at the present time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</strong> is a sleep assessment that has the time frame intermediate between these two. It assesses the sleep quality of the <strong>previous month</strong>, and this time frame allows it to be free of the limitations in other assessment methods. The <strong>intermediate time frame</strong> of two to three weeks is, therefore, often used clinically to differentiate fleeting from persistent sleep wake disorders. Consequently, many researchers consider PSQI as reliable and validated and use it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A PSQI consists of <strong>nineteen self-rated questions</strong> that assess sleep quality through estimates of sleep duration, latency, and frequency and severity of specific sleep-related problems. These questions are grouped into seven component scores that are each weighted equally on a 0-3 scale. Then, the seven component scores are summed for a global PSQI score (range of 0-21), with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality. The PSQI also includes five questions rated by a bed partner or roommate. They are used for clinical information only and are not taken into account for the scoring of the PSQI. The entire index requires 5-10 minutes for completion and 5 minutes to score.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, assessment of the <strong>three main aspects of sleep</strong> (amount, quantity, and architecture) can be done through a series of <strong>direct questions</strong>. These questions are divided into the respective sections. Questions for assessment on the amount of sleep include "What time do you usually feel tired?" and "When do you actually go to bed?" Questions for assessment on sleep architecture include "Do you have a set bedtime?" and "During the school week, do you sleep more or less than you do on weekends?" Questions for assessment on sleep quality include "Do you ever have problems falling asleep? How many times in the last month have you had such problems?" and "How often do you wake up in the middle of the night or early morning?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Meanwhile, <strong>assessment of risk factors</strong> for disrupted or insufficient sleep involve assessing activities, habits, and environmental elements that can influence sleep. These factors include work, exercise habits, exposure to and use of electronic screens, and alcohol and caffeine usage. More information is available on the Sleep Quality webpage.

                <p>
                    Do you know that people who sleep more and better often get better grades? In fact, multiple studies have found a <strong>correlation between sleep deprivation and academic performance</strong>. The 2019 MIT study provided one of the most important insights to this subject. It revealed that <strong>nearly 25% of variance in academic performance</strong> is attributed to sleep. The study used objective measures of sleep duration and quality to ensure its reliability and produced findings that helped conclude that <strong>better quality, longer duration, and greater consistency of sleep</strong> correlate with better grades.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The study found that enhanced sleep quality and longer duration led to <strong>academic success</strong>. Factors such as earlier average bedtime, earlier wake-up time, greater duration of sleep, and enhanced quality of sleep positively correlated to <strong>higher overall scores</strong> in chemistry class. On the other hand, the study indicated that greater inconsistency in sleep led to lower grades. Students with the routine of sleeping less during weekdays and oversleeping on weekends were, as can be assumed, associated with worse performance. But there are some times when we do not have the luxury of a good, long sleep–like in exam periods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Does this mean that you will most likely receive lower grades after cramming late the day before? Researchers note this is not necessarily true. Research showed that there was <strong>no relation found between the single night before the test and one's performance</strong>. The positive correlation was rather more relevant to sleep duration and quality of the month and week before the test. This indicates that long consistency is important for good sleep and improved academic performance. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, sleeping well provides <strong>cognitive gains</strong>. Sleep solidifies memories of the day and can assist with recalling what you studied. Although the exact mechanisms behind the relationship between sleep, memory, and neuro-plasticity are yet unknown, there exists a general understanding. It is that sleep <strong>strengthens synaptic connections</strong> that were active during awake-periods, ultimately resulting in the consolidation of memory and successful academic performance. When memory consolidation takes place, the brain goes through a process of filtering. The brain consolidates important things while filtering out the unimportant ones. Consequently, without sufficient sleep, the cognitive function suffers and the capacity to learn decreases.. Lack of sleep, on the other hand, leads to poor attention and cognition. Sleep deprivation. Due to the same reason, lack of sleep increases fatigue and sleepiness while worsening cognitive performance. In fact, it is known that the cognitive performance of those who have been awake for 17 hours is equal to one who has a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05%.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As mentioned, sleep is associated with academic performance. <strong>Sleep deficit</strong> leads to lack of concentration and attention during class. Inconsistency in sleep schedule, also referred to as the <strong>social jet lag</strong>, negatively correlates with academic performance (Note: Refer to Teen Sleep webpage for more information). Indeed, adolescents with greater sleep inconsistency are found across studies to <strong>perform worse</strong> than peers who sleep well. A study discovered some interesting <strong>gender differences</strong> on various factors of sleep and good sleep quality. For instance, sleep inconsistency  and quality significantly correlated in both males and females but stronger in males. This indicates that males need to pay more attention to long-duration sleep for a good night's sleep.

                <p>
                    Now let's move on to how sleep deprivation affects <strong>mood, focus, and emotional regulation</strong>. Research finds that not only can sleep deprivation lower teens' abilities to concentrate but can also lead to anxiety, depression, and thoughts of suicide. In a study, subjects were limited to only four and a half hours of sleep a night for one week. Researchers observed that they became <strong>more stressed, angry, sad, and mentally exhausted</strong> as the experiment progressed. Once they resumed normal sleep, however, there was a dramatic improvement in their moods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, sleep is often believed to <strong>regulate emotions</strong>. Lack of sleep can make people more receptive to negative information. As a result, sleep deprivation is frequently linked to anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. Intriguingly, mood and sleep do not work in a one way direction. It works <strong>both ways</strong>, with anxiety and stress influencing sleep results. Anxiety, for example, can lead to agitation and arousal, making it difficult to sleep. Meanwhile, stress arouses the body and keeps it awake and alert. As a result, many people under constant stress or abnormally exaggerated responses to it have sleep problems. <Strong>Chronic insomnia</Strong>, on the other hand, may increase risk of developing mood disorders. Surprisingly, there is a big relationship between psychiatric and psychological problems and sleep. This means that depressed and or anxious people have trouble with sleep.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Difficulty sleeping is also sometimes considered the first symptom of <strong>depression</strong>. Data indicates that 15-20% of people diagnosed with insomnia develop major depression. Vice versa, depressed people may have abnormal sleep patterns. Therefore, sleep problems are associated with <strong>psychological problems</strong>. For instance, chronic insomnia may increase an individual's risk of developing mood disorder. This makes insomnia a reliable predictor of depression and many other psychiatric disorders. The same study also discovered that people with insomnia are twenty times more likely to develop panic disorder. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Adolescence</strong> is an important period for development, and sleep plays an instrumental role in it. As a result, sleep deprivation can be especially <strong>dangerous</strong> to teenagers. Lack of sleep can risk development of <strong>problematic behavior</strong> in the future. A study found that adolescents with less sleep had less connectivity between parts of the brain that play important roles in decision making, self-reflection, and processing information. Malfunctions in these brain parts are generally linked to mental illnesses such as depression, ADHD, and schizophrenia. Children with less brain connectivity in this region are also more likely to show behavioral issues such as poor impulse control and aggressiveness. According to Assaf Oshri, corresponding author of the study and professor in the UGA College of Family and Consumer Sciences, sleep affects children's "mental health impact and helps them regulate their emotions."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Corroborating on the connection between lack of sleep and problematic behavior, Oshri also states that Sleep duration & sleep efficiency are "linked to distinct patterns of brain network connectivity that are predictive of problem behaviors." Lack of quality sleep can make learning to regulate emotions and <strong>control impulses harder</strong> for children. Additionally, sleeping habits impact adolescents' brains' function, which can also influence mental health outcomes.

                <p>
                    <strong>Chronic sleep deprivation</strong> can even have adverse effects on your health. Sleep loss (less than 7 hours of night) may have wide-ranging effects on different bodily systems, including cardiovascular, endocrine, immune, and nervous systems. To begin with, sleep deprivation can lead to obesity. The shorter the sleep, the greater the <strong>obesity (measured by BMI) severity</strong> observed was. According to a study, by age 27, individuals with short sleep duration (less than 6 hours) were 7.5 times more likely to have a higher BMI. Adults who slept 7.7 hours had the lowest BMI, while either shorter or longer sleep duration led to progressively higher numbers. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This correlation can be attributed to <strong>how sleep insufficiency increases appetite</strong>. Sleep insufficiency is associated with lower levels of leptin and higher ghrelin levels Leptin is a hormone produced by an adipose tissue hormone that suppresses appetite. As a result, when lower levels of leptin are exhibited, individuals' appetite improves. Obesity can also affect sleep. It can cause <strong>obstructive sleep apnea</strong>, which mostly occurs through fat deposition in airways (become narrow). Secondly, sleep is associated with diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (Note: Impaired glucose tolerance is a precursor to diabetes indicated by glucose levels rising higher than normal and for a longer period after intravenous dose of glucose). Middle-aged and older adults who reported 5 hours of sleep or less were 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes compared to those who slept 7-8 hours per day. They also displayed impaired glucose tolerance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lastly, sleep is linked to <strong>cardiovascular disease and hypertension</strong>. For both short and long sleep duration, the likelihood of nonfatal and fatal heart attack is modestly included. 5 hours of sleep was associated with 45% increase in risk, and risks similarly increased for durations equal to or longer than 9 hours. Sleep deprivation is also related to anxiety symptoms, depression, and alcohol use. Sleep loss is also connected to disease mortality, with progressively shorter or longer sleep duration being associated with greater mobility. <strong>Sleep-loss-related mortality</strong> seems to be largely from acute heart attacks.

                    Studies on <strong>sleep quality</strong> started later than those on sleep quantity. Actually, it began in 1989 when Ford and Kamerow revealed that insomnia increases risk of psychiatric disorders. Since then, its importance has been <strong>stressed</strong> repeatedly. According to Linhao Zhang, lead author of the study and a recent doctoral graduate of the College of Family and Consumer Sciences, "It's not just about how long you slept. It's <strong>how well</strong> did you sleep? Did you take a long time to fall asleep? Did you wake up in the middle of the night?" The quote reflects on how significant sleep quality is viewed in more recent studies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A nationwide research team on the quality of sleep has made a claim along the same line, stating that <strong>sleep quality is a better indicator than sleep quantity</strong> in assessing sleep. Restfulness obtained through sleep is a useful index for assessing sleep quality. As a result, researchers recommend individuals to <strong>pay more attention</strong> to obtaining good quality sleep. Not enough studies have been conducted on the relationships between sleep quality and health or disorders in children and adolescents. Despite this, we are aware that there is an association between good quality sleep and better general health. Authors of a research study also identified factors affecting sleep quality of children and adolescents. They "found that evening circadian preference, mobile phone and Internet use, number of other activities (music, television, gaming console, sport, etc.) after 21:00, late turning off time, and number of devices in the bedroom had an unfavorable effect on sleep quality."

                    Javaheri et al.'s investigation on association between sleep variables (quantity and quality) and blood pressure in adolescents aged 13-16 revealed valuable insights on the <strong>effect of lack of sleep and health</strong>. In this research, short sleep duration (6.5hr or less) and low sleep efficiency (85% or less) were used for sleep variables. Odds for prehypertension (Blood pressure being at or above 90% of the age, gender, and height standardized value) was increased 4.5-fold among participants with low sleep efficiency & 2.8-fold in those with short sleep duration. Those with poor sleep quality (low sleep efficiency) found to have systolic blood pressure 4.0mmHg <strong>higher</strong> than other adolescents.
