                    Many people wrongly believe that <strong>sleep</strong> is a simple process–you go to bed, then you fall asleep. 
                    However, this is not quite accurate as sleep is governed by <strong>biology</strong>, not simple magic. In fact, 
                    the body relies on <strong>internal systems</strong> such as the circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep drive to 
                    go to sleep. And even sleep itself is not one concept–it is divided into different <strong>stages</strong>, each 
                    characterized by different reactions from our body.

                <p>
                    Let us first learn about the <strong>stages of sleep</strong>. It's important to make distinctions between the stages to know what really happens while sleeping. There are four stages of sleep, and they can be categorized into two big groups: <strong>non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep</strong>. As the names suggest, <strong>NREM sleep</strong> is when eye movements are absent. Stages in this category are characterized by a dominating parasympathetic nervous system and slow regular heart and respiratory rates. REM sleep is when bursts of rapid eye movements take place. There is an absence of muscle tone, and stages in this category are characterized by a dominating sympathetic nervous system and fast irregular heart and respiratory rates. <strong>NREM sleep</strong> consists of three separate stages (N1, N2, and N3) while REM is considered as one. The differences between the stages are distinct brain wave patterns, eye movementment presence or absence, and degrees of muscle tone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>N1</strong> is the transition between wakefulness and sleep. In this stage, the body has <strong>not fully relaxed yet</strong>, and one's body and brain activities just start to slow down. One can wake up easily by an external stimulus (referred to as low arousal threshold) as it is considered the lightest stage. However, if there are no interruptions, individuals quickly move on to N2. During <strong>N2</strong>, one is in a <strong>subdued state</strong>. In this state, one's body temperature generally goes down, while muscles relax and the heart rate and breathing slow down. In this stage, polysomnographic measures (polysomnography: diagnostic es that records physiological responses during sleep) indicate frequent bursts of low-voltage, fast frequency EEG waveforms <strong>(spindles)</strong> and high-voltage, slow-frequency EEG spikes <strong>(K-complexes)</strong>. Normally, half of one's entire sleep is spent in N2. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>N3</strong>, also known as deep sleep or slow wave sleep (SWS), is when it becomes <strong>harder to wake up</strong> (referred to as high arousal threshold). During N3, one's muscle tone, pulse, and breathing rate decrease, and the brain activity exhibits an identifiable pattern. These detectable patterns are delta waves, which gives N3 its other name of <strong>"delta sleep."</strong> N3 is considered very important for restorative sleep as it fosters <strong>body recovery and growth</strong>. Individuals spend most time in N3 during the first half of the night, and the N3 stages get progressively shorter as one continues sleeping (REM sleep decreases overall). Overall, NREM is characterized by minimal mental activity and a movable body. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>REM sleep</strong> is when rapid eye movements occur and muscle twitches are present. During REM, the body experiences <strong>atonia</strong> (temporary muscle paralysis), with the eyes and muscles being exceptions to this–they move rapidly. In this stage, brain activity picks up and gets closer to what it is like when one is <strong>awake</strong>. For this reason, many experts associate REM with vivid dreams, stating that the increase in brain activity explains the presence of dreams. While they agree that dreams can happen in any sleep stage, they are more common and intense in REM episodes. This stage is believed to be crucial for cognitive functions such as <strong>memory</strong> as well. Overall, REM is characterized by eye movements and absence of muscle tone. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    NREM and REM sleep continue to alternate through the night as a <strong>cycle</strong>. REM sleep episodes typically become longer across night while NREM becomes shorter. An average NREM-REM sleep cycle is approximately 90-110 minutes, while the first is shorter, being 70-100 minutes. In the first cycle, 1-7 minutes are started with N1 sleep. In this stage, sleep is easily discontinued due to a <strong>low arousal threshold</strong>. Throughout the night, transitional stages occur in this stage. Severely disrupted sleep is often marked by an increase in occurrences/percentages of N1 sleep. The next 10-25 minutes are spent in N2 sleep. Compared to N1 sleep, the arousal threshold is <strong>higher</strong>, so individuals need more stimuli to wake up. In this stage, high-voltage slow waves start to appear and eventually lead to N3 sleep. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following 20-40 minutes are spent in N3 sleep. This stage is classified by more than 50% high voltage slow wave activity in EEG activity. Lastly, REM sleep takes place for under 10 minutes. During this stage, the <strong>arousal threshold is variable</strong>. Some researchers have theorized that arousal stimulus is incorporated into the ongoing <strong>dream story</strong> rather than waking the individual up. The percentages of each sleep is as follows: N1 2-5%, N2 45-55%, N3 (SWS) 10-20%, and REM 20-25%. During adolescence, there is a quantitative change in SWS. SWS decreases by about 40% even if the nocturnal sleep is constant.

                <p>
                    But what <strong>regulates the sleep/wake cycle</strong> in the first place? This is a question that can be answered by the "Two Process Model of Sleep Regulation." In this model, the circadian component is called <strong>Process C</strong> and the homeostatic sleep/wake component is called <strong>Process S</strong>. The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour internal clock in our brain. This system regulates cycles of alertness and sleepiness (sleep/wake cycle) and <strong>responds to light changes</strong> in the environment. Indeed, the system evolves to help adapt to changes in the surroundings, anticipating changes in radiation, temperature, and food availability. The central clock, also known as <strong>suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)</strong>, generates and regulates the body's circadian rhythm. Recent discoveries have revealed, however, that there are also secondary clocks in organs (including the heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, intestines, skin, lymphocytes, esophagus, spleen, thymus, adrenal gland, prostate, and olfactory bulb) that support the system. These organs are independent yet still synchronized with the SCN as well as other factors such as temperature and timing of meals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the <strong>circadian rhythm</strong> is a biological clock that optimizes environmental adaptation, energy utilization, and tissue repair. The system integrates hormonal, metabolic, and immune systems to adapt to the environmental periodicity. It regulates the synthesis and activity of <strong>hormones, neurotransmitters, metabolites, and immunomodulators</strong>–all while ensuring that cellular processes are synchronized with environmental signals. The circadian rhythm is important as the sleep/wake cycle helps replenish and heal the body, allowing for proper functioning. Proper sleep allows the body to engage in circadian rhythms. In turn, circadian rhythms build energy stores that can be used for metabolic processes, neuronal remodeling for synaptic function, memory consolidation, and assimilation of complex motor systems. Such organism-wide homeostasis allows for precise temporal coordination (process of aligning actions) and functional output from the network of clocks.

                <p>
                    Let us learn more about the importance and role of <strong>SCN</strong> in particular. SCN is located in the hypothalamus in the brain. As the central clock, the SCN sets the pace for circadian rhythms. Light is detected by the eyes through specialized retinal ganglion cells, which send signals through the optic nerve. The light signal passes through the retinohypothalamic pathway and activates the SCN. The activated SCN releases GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, which in turn inhibits the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The inhibition of PVN prevents signals from travelling through the intermediolateral nucleus and the superior cervical ganglion, and the sympathetic nervous system is made inactive. The pineal gland needs sympathetic stimulation to release melatonin. As a result, when there is no sympathetic signal, no melatonin is secreted. This shows how light signals are processed by the SCN to regulate the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that induces sleep. This allows SCN to regulate sleep. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, the <strong>homeostatic sleep drive</strong> is a process based on the idea of "sleep pressure." It is seen as a process independent of circadian timing and largely surrounds the concept that longer awake time increases sleep pressure whereas sleep dissipates it. Typical physiological markers for <strong>"sleep pressure"</strong> include slow wave activity observed through the EEG and SWS. Generally, SWA is high at the beginning of the nocturnal sleep episode when sleep pressure is greatest. By contrast, <strong>SWA exponentially declines</strong> across the night's NREM episodes as sleep lowers sleep pressure. The two systems, circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep drive, interact to determine the timing, depth, and duration of sleep. However, how this happens is not yet fully understood.

                <p>
                    Different hormones, neurotransmitters, and brain regions work <strong>together</strong> to regulate sleep. Let's first learn about hormones–more specifically, melatonin, glucocorticoids, and growth hormone. <strong>Melatonin</strong> is a hormone synthesized from the tryptophan through a series of enzymatic reactions and mainly secreted by the pineal gland. Its synthesis is light-dependent as light information is processed to regulate its secretion (refer to previous section for more info). Melatonin performs several physiological functions, including the activation of MT1/MT2 receptors. By activating the MT1/MT2 receptors, melatonin inhibits SCN neuronal activity and lowers core body temperature, ultimately increasing sleep-propensity (likelihood of falling asleep at any given moment). Melatonin also helps regulate the circadian rhythm, contributing to <strong>sleep regulation</strong>.
                </p>
<img src="T1 Sleep Bio Photo 3.jpg" alt="Glucocorticoids" class="my-image">
                <p>
                    <strong>Glucocorticoids</strong> (Note: cortisol is a type of glucocorticoids) are hormones synthesized from cholesterol in the adrenal cortex. It performs important <strong>regulatory functions</strong> such as catalyzing catabolism of macromolecules (like proteins and lipids) and maintaining glucose homeostasis. They are reliable biomarkers of circadian homeostasis as they are characterized by a distinct circadian pattern, in which they peak in the early morning and gradually decline by midnight. As a result, dysregulation of this pattern indicates a <strong>circadian disruption</strong>. For example, total sleep deprivation and chronic circadian misalignment change cortisol levels of individuals. This results in changes in individuals' cortisol levels that are associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome, musculoskeletal disorders, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

<img src="T1 Sleep Bio Photo 4.jpg" alt="Growh Hormone" class="my-image">
                <p>
                    <strong>Growth hormone</strong> is a hormone that accelerates growth in children with hypopituitarism. It is synthesized in the anterior pituitary and plays many important roles in the body: promoting protein synthesis, maintaining muscle mass and strength, and accelerating wound healing. This hormone peaks during <strong>puberty</strong>, then continuously declines as individuals attain adult height. Its release is modulated by hypothalamic signals, including output from the SCN. It has a distinct circadian rhythm, where a pulsatile release occurs shortly after sleep onset in temporal association with the first SWS episode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we will learn about involved <strong>neurotransmitters</strong>–in particular, histamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. <strong>Histaminergic cells</strong>, located in the posterior hypothalamus of the brain, play a major role in promoting wakefulness. Active histaminergic neurons <strong>increase alertness</strong> while helping maintain sustained wakefulness. By contrast, GABAergic neurons promote sleep and significantly and directly inhibit hisaminergic cells and wake-promoting cells. Overall, the reduction in histamine activity leads to sleepiness and sleep onset, and sleep is only possible in the absence of histamine. When the posterior hypothalamus containing the histamine (wake center) is damaged, individuals suffer due to constant sleepiness. When the anterior hypothalamus and basal forebrain that contain GABA (sleep center) is damaged, individuals experience persistent insomnia. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Norepinephrine-producing neurons</strong> are active during wakefulness and inactive during REM sleep. Their inactivity during REM contributes to the characteristic features of REM sleep, atonia (temporary muscle paralysis). Norepinephrine is known to play a critical role in maintaining muscle tone during wakefulness, as observed by its absence during cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone during consciousness. Similarly, their inactivity during REM sleep leads to muscle paralysis. Norepinephrine supports arousal indirectly by maintaining muscle tone and stabilizing wakefulness. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that maintains arousal, regulates muscle tone, and manages some phasic events of REM sleep. It is inactive in sleep, especially in REM sleep, and its absence contributes to the distinct characteristics of REM sleep. The absence of serotonin removes suppression, causing PGO spikes (high voltage electrical activity) and release of eye movement and twitches, key indicators of REM sleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the brain, the basal forebrain, reticular activating system, thalamus, and hypothalamus play instrumental roles in controlling sleep. <strong>The basal forebrain (BF)</strong> is a group of nuclei located at the base of the brain. It plays an important role in regulating cortical activity, which impacts wakefulness and certain sleep stages. The BF promotes cortical activity, especially during wakefulness and REM sleep. It contains a diverse population of neurons such as cholinergic neurons, GABAergic neurons (promote sleep), and glutamatergic neurons (support arousal). Such diversity allows the BF to be involved in both sleep and wake regulation and play an important role in <strong>sleep control</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The reticular activating system (RAS)</strong> is formed by a group of neurons extending diffusely from the medulla to the posterior hypothalamus. It is involved in maintaining wakefulness and receives afferent signals (sensory signals) from varied sensory systems (including light, sound, and movement). The RAS sends excitatory signals to the basal forebrain, thalamus, and hypothalamus, regions which activate the cerebral cortex and <strong>promote wakefulness</strong>. The thalamus plays an important role in modulating the sleep-wake cycle. It acts as a relay station for the glutamatergic sensory inputs to the cortex, meaning that all sensory signals pass through it before reaching the cortex. During wakefulness, thalamic neurons actively relay sensory information to the cortex, supporting <strong>alertness</strong>. However, during sleep, these neurons decrease their relay activity, resulting in the filtering or blocking of sensory input to the cortex. Overall, such reduction helps maintain sleep by preventing an overflow of sensory stimuli that may lead to awakening. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>hypothalamus</strong> is a region deep within the brain that manages the body's <strong>homeostasis</strong> and controls the <strong>sleep-wake cycle</strong>. The region contains the SCN which sets the pace of the circadian rhythm (refer to previous section). Particularly, the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), and median preoptic area (MNPO) contribute to sleep regulation. <strong>TMN</strong> is a major wake center that promotes arousal through release of histamine. Turning off TMN histamine neurons makes one fall into deep SWS fast. Contrastingly, the preoptic area consisting of the <strong>VLPO</strong> and <strong>MNPO</strong> contain neurons that generate sleep. These neurons send inhibitory projections to areas that promote arousal, generating sleep. They are most active during NREM and REM sleep.
