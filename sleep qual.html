            <p>
                Often, we refer to <strong>good, sound sleep</strong> as "a good night's sleep." In slightly more complicated 
                language, we can refer to this as <strong>sleep of high quality</strong>. Sleep quality is generally considered 
                a good measure of how comfortable or refreshing your sleep was. But what affects our sleep quality 
                in the first place? Have you ever wondered why some people may sleep better than others? 
                Why on some nights do you sleep better? Although genetics also plays a part, <strong>our lifestyle habits, sleep environment, and mental health</strong>
                 significantly shape sleep quality. <strong>Caffeine and sugar consumption</strong> 
                also greatly affects sleep, especially for teenagers.

            <p>
                Let us first learn about how <strong>lifestyle habits</strong> such as screen time, diet, and exercise affect <strong>sleep quality</strong>. Most people nowadays have scrolled through their phone right before bed, at least once. In fact, you probably have done so as well. You might have noticed that after a night like that, you feel groggier in the morning than usual. This is not a random phenomenon. Indeed, researchers have noticed that <strong>evening exposure to light</strong> from computer screens and electronic devices <strong>disrupts sleep continuity and quality</strong>. Exposure to light before bed has been associated with lengthened sleep latency, reduced sleep duration, and increased number of nocturnal awakenings. <strong>Changes</strong> have also been observed in sleep stages. The most pronounced effects have been seen in <strong>NREM sleep</strong>; lighter sleep stages increased, while deep sleep (SWS) decreased. This means that usage of screens in the evening negatively affects your overall sleep quality by reducing the stage (SWS) that helps your body recover and refresh for the morning. Many studies have verified these findings, presenting that <strong>excessive smartphone usage</strong> is a factor contributing to adverse sleep quality.
            </p>

            <p>
                Why does this happen? Scientifically speaking, it is caused by the <strong>blue light from the LEDs</strong>. Light suppresses melatonin secretion in humans (Note: melatonin is a hormone that induces sleep–for more information, refer to the sleep biology webpage). Humans have the strongest response (greatest reduction in secretion) for the short-wavelength portion, which appears blue (thus the name, blue light). Supporting this idea, blue monochromatic light has been said to be more effective than longer-wavelength light for <strong>enhancing alertness</strong>. As a result, risk factors of exposure to blue light in the evening include disturbed circadian rhythms and sleep loss. These risk factors collectively and negatively contribute to sleep quality. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Although definitive conclusions have not been drawn yet, <strong>diet</strong> is also speculated to affect sleep quality. Researchers studying the correlation between different food types and sleep quality across various cases have made several suggestions for the health of the general public. They recommend the general population to increase their <strong>fruit and vegetable</strong> intakes, choose <strong>whole grains</strong> (higher in fiber), and favor <strong>vegetable oils</strong>. Research paper "Effects of Diet on Sleep Quality" has concluded that "dietary patterns that favor HC intakes are associated with reduced SOL and SWS and increased REM." HF intakes have been associated with "lower SE and REM and higher SWS and arousals." They also suggest that "some foods, such as milk products, fish, fruit, and vegetables, also show sleep-promoting effects." However, they point out that studies have been too diverse, short, and small to conclude definitively. (Note: HC refers to High-Carbohydrate diet, and HF refers to High-Fat diet). 
            </p>

            <p>
                Additionally, <strong>physical activity</strong> has been discovered to improve sleep. Although researchers do not completely understand why this happens, they have concluded this to be a fact.  Moderate aerobic exercise <strong>increases the amount of SWS</strong> (deep sleep, considered a chance for the brain and body to rejuvenate–for more information, refer to the sleep biology webpage). Exercise has also been found to help stabilize mood, positively impacting mental health. 
            </p>

            <p>
                There are some meaningful connections that can be made between <strong>working out</strong> and its effects on the body as well as sleep. To begin with, aerobic exercise causes the body to <strong>release endorphins</strong>. These endorphins create a level of activity in the brain, which can keep some individuals awake (depends on the person). Researchers suggest these people do exercise at least 1-2 hours before bed so that they can get wind-down time for good sleep. Secondly, exercise <strong>increases core body temperature</strong>. Increase in body temperature signals the bodyclock that it is time to be awake. However, 30-90 minutes after exercise, the core body temperature starts falling. This facilitates sleepiness. Researchers state that optimal time to exercise depends on the individual. What applies to most is that engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise may positively influence sleep quality. <strong>Elevated heart rate</strong>, in fact, creates biological processes in the brain and body that contribute to sleep of better quality.

            <p>
                This might not come as a surprise, but your <strong>sleep environment</strong> can markedly affect your sleep quality. 
                Inappropriate sleep environments can lead to disrupted sleep and reduced sleep quality. As a result, 
                it's important to know what environment is generally best for good sleep and apply the knowledge to 
                your own sleeping area. Main factors that affect sleep quality are <strong>noise, ambient temperature, humidity, light, and air quality</strong>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's first learn about how <strong>noise</strong> is connected to sleep. Magnitude of sleep disruption depends on the decibel level (dB), frequency and pitch, duration, and whether the noise is meaningful (e.g., a familiar voice would be meaningful). Research has indicated that higher levels of noise affects duration of sleep stages and increased sleep fragmentation <strong>(sleep disruptions)</strong>. More frequent pulses can cause more sleep disruption as well, though there are large interindividual differences in noise sensitivity. A working group report from the World Health Organization (WHO) on noise determines a casual relationship between nighttime noise exposure and self-reported sleep disturbances and health problems, use of pharmaceuticals, and insomnia-like symptoms. Louder noises are needed to wake individuals from deeper stages of sleep.  Overall, findings suggest that quiet environments are better for sleep but that continuous noise may help dampen intermittent noises. In general, individuals perceive <strong>intermittent noise as more disruptive</strong> to sleep than continuous noise. In fact, exposure to intermittent noises above 35 dB are associated with reduced sleep quality and quantity. As a result, use of continuous white noise can help minimize sleep disruption and be useful for better sleep.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Ambient temperature</strong> is also associated with sleep quality. Core body temperature tends to decline during sleep. Such drop in heat production is due to reduction in metabolic rate and heat loss due to inactivity. By contrast, proximal and distal skin temperatures rise during sleep. As a result, during wake and sleep, core and skin temperatures interact and maintain a balance between heat loss and production. <strong>Ambient thermoneutrality</strong> is the point where ambient air temperature allows for optimal maintenance of the core and temperature. When the core temperature is 36-38˚C and that of skin is 32˚C in the absence of clothing and bedding, ambient thermoneutrality <strong>ranges</strong> from 27.9-28.5˚C. Ambient temperature above this can lead to an uncomfortable environment and induce sweating. Contrastingly, temperature above this range can cause shivering. When insulation (clothing and blanket) are used, hotter ambient temperatures are more disruptive to sleep than colder temperatures. This is most likely because the insulating material allows individuals to adjust the sleep environment during their sleep. Warmer temperatures within the thermoneutral zone have been discovered to allow for warmer skin temperatures and facilitate sleep onset. Cooler temperatures within this zone can enhance slow wave sleep. However, temperatures either above or below this zone lead to poor sleep quality. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Humidity</strong> also plays a role in shaping your sleep. Optimal humidity for human comfort <strong>ranges</strong> between 40-60%. As humidity levels rise above this, temperatures can feel hotter than they actually are. Similarly, as they fall below, temperatures feel colder. Sleep is negatively affected when humidity levels are outside the optimal range. As a result, maintaining humidity levels in a sleep environment is important. Using a humidifier for dry areas and a dehumidifier in humid areas can help.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Light</strong> is another important factor that impacts sleep. Light leads to sleep disruption as it <strong>resets the circadian pacemaker</strong>. Thus, inappropriately timed light exposure can inhibit sleep onset by shifting the circadian phase. Overall, this can affect sleep on subsequent nights. Research has suggested that evening light exposure as low as 65 lux can shift the circadian phase of melatonin by one hour, when compared to light exposure of 3 lux. Impacts on the circadian rhythm also depend on the <strong>intensity</strong> of the light. The human circadian pacemaker is most sensitive to short-wavelength light (460-480nm range). <strong>Blue light</strong> leads to greater melatonin suppression and has significant effects on the phase shift. Unlike blue light, low intensity red light does not suppress melatonin. Exposure to blue light of a high color temperature or narrow bandwidth before bed alters the distribution of slow wave and REM sleep. By contrast, exposure to red light 30 minutes before bed has been associated with improved self-reported sleep quality, shorter sleep latency, and increased sleep duration. Light is also considered an environmental stimulus that causes sleep disruption and nocturnal arousals. Light pollution can disrupt sleep. Overall this information suggests it is important to reduce blue light exposure before bed, increase red light exposure, and avoid light pollution.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although not always considered, <strong>air quality</strong> can affect sleep as well. Poor air quality can lead to sleep disruptions and <strong>impaired breathing during sleep</strong>. Studies indicate that exposure to reduced oxygen and elevated carbon dioxide can disrupt sleep. Poor air quality, cigarette smoke, and room scents have also been associated with lower sleep quality. Oxygen enrichment has been found to increase SWS and reduce apneas among individuals who sleep at altitude. As a result, supplemental oxygen may be useful in mitigating negative effects of sleeping at altitude. Ventilation during sleep is also important for ensuring adequate sleep quality. It is possible that some scents enhance deep sleep, but further research is needed to prove this idea.

            <img src="T2 Sleep Quality Photo 3.png" alt="Sleep & Mental Health" class="my-image">

            <p>
                Sleep is connected to our <strong>mental health</strong>. In fact, most people with depression have sleep issues. Sleep and mental health have a <strong>bidirectional relationship</strong>, meaning that poor sleep contributes to development of depression, whereas depression makes sleep issues more likely. The two have a complicated relationship, and it is hard to tell which comes first. What we do know, however, is that sleep problems such as insomnia, hypersomnia, and obstructive sleep apnea are typically associated with <strong>depression</strong>. Research has found out that 20% of depressed people have obstructive sleep apnea and 15% have hypersomnia, corroborating this point.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sleep issues are speculated to affect sleep quality by influencing the function of <strong>serotonin,</strong> a neurotransmitter that contributes to depression. Sleep disruptions (poor sleep) can affect the body's stress system and circadian rhythms. It also increases vulnerability for <strong>depression</strong>. As a result, sleep problems can contribute to depression. Additionally, sleep problems can increase risk of initially developing depression. <strong>Persistent sleep issues</strong> also increase risk of relapse of depression. In many cases, depression causes fragmented sleep, making depressed individuals more sleepy and fatigued during waking hours. Depressed individuals are recommended to sleep at least 7 hours for good health.
            </p>

            <p>
                What are some <strong>healthy habits</strong> that can help sleep better, boost our moods, and decrease symptoms of depression? The answer comes down to four essential parts. Firstly, having a <strong>consistent sleep schedule</strong> is a must-do. Ensuring 7 hours of sleep everyday can be helpful. Secondly, <strong>napping carefully</strong> is important. Many individuals do not consider how long they should nap for a healthy schedule; most simply nap based on their level of fatigue, believing this is the most healthy way. Naps during the day are often caused by restless or inconsistent sleep. Although napping for a long time may seem enticing, they can interfere with the ability to sleep during the night. Consequently, researchers recommend individuals to take <strong>"power naps"</strong> that last for 10 to 20 minutes. These naps help regulate emotions, reduce sleepiness, and lead to better performance. Naps longer than 20 minutes can limit the ability to sleep in the evening, and those shorter than 10 minutes are not long enough to gain the benefits of napping.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thirdly, going outside is helpful. <strong>Exposure to sunlight</strong> aligns the body's internal clock and <strong>circadian rhythms</strong>. As the sun sets, the body produces melatonin to induce sleepiness and promote sleep. That is why exposure to the outside environment can foster a good night's sleep. Lastly, exercising regularly is beneficial. As mentioned earlier in this web page (refer to section "Lifestyle Habits and Sleep Quality" for more info), the mechanism behind how exercise results in good sleep is a mystery. However, researchers have observed that those that engage in exercise report good sleep quality. <strong>Regular exercise</strong> been found to greatly decrease symptoms of depression.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Anxiety and sleep</strong> are also connected to one another. They often work in a <strong>cycle</strong>, and the pattern affects both mood and concentration and sometimes even long-term health issues. Anxiety is more common than you might think. Indeed, <strong>anxiety disorders</strong> are the most common type of mental illness, with 20% of American adults being diagnosed with it. It often involves worry and unease. So how does it relate to sleep? To begin with, serious sleep disturbances are symptoms of anxiety disorders. The logic is simple: people with <strong>worry</strong> tend to worry in bed, leading to sleep disruptions. Insomnia (State marked by worry that is caused by mental hyperarousal) is a common symptom of these disorders. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Anxiety</strong> about going to sleep can disrupt sleep as well. Negative thoughts about going to bed (this is a type of "anticipation anxiety") create challenges to healthy schedules and routines. Such anxiety and pre-sleep rumination may affect vivid dreaming during REM sleep, <strong>provoking nightmares</strong> and ultimately disrupting sleep. These nightmares can also exacerbate the <strong>fear</strong> of going to sleep and eventually compound the negative effect on sleep. As mentioned, anxiety and sleep are connected in the opposite cause and effect relationship as well. People with obstructive sleep apnea, for example, have higher rates of mental health problems. These problems include depression, anxiety, and panic disorders.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's now learn about methods to treat these anxiety disorders. Firstly, improving <strong>sleep hygiene</strong> can help combat them. Better sleep can help fight anxiety. Hence, healthy sleep habits and a consistent schedule are important. Creating a more <strong>comfortable sleep environment</strong> by eliminating sources of sleep disruption can also foster good sleep. Additionally, avoiding caffeine and alcohol in the evening is a must. Secondly, <strong>relaxation strategies</strong> can be used to treat the disorders. Relaxation exercises such as deep breathing or mindfulness meditation sessions can break the cycle. Scheduling time to actively worry can also eliminate time spent worrying when going to bed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thirdly, <strong>color noise</strong> can be used. There are a myriad of options for color noise and the selection depends on your preference. White, pink, and brown noise are some of the most common ones. <strong>White noise</strong> is consistent across all frequencies and can thus obscure various sounds in the environment. <strong>Pink noise</strong> is softer and naturally balanced and is perceived as more calming to some. <strong>Brown noise</strong>, on the other hand, emphasizes lower frequencies and can be soothing for anxiety. If you are considering using color noise to sleep. It is recommended that you experiment and find out what works best for you personally. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Curiously, many individuals find that their anxiety <strong>intensifies</strong> at night. Hormonal fluctuations, changes in cortisol levels, and relatively quiet environments are attributed to this phenomenon as they make anxious thoughts more noticeable. Collectively, all these factors contribute to worsened sleep. However, just because so many factors contribute to the problem it does not mean we cannot fix it. With the mentioned strategies, it is highly possible to sleep better.

            <p>
                <strong>Caffeine and sugar</strong> have become a part of our daily lives. Really, there likely won't be a single person around us that does not regularly consume either of these or even both. Numerous different foods and beverages contain alkaloid caffeine. For instance, coffee, tea, coke, ice tea, chocolate, and energy drinks all contain caffeine. In fact, it is almost impossible to not consume these on a regular basis. Regular caffeine consumption in young people including adolescents have also been observed, reflecting on this recent <strong>trend</strong>. Aligning with such trends, reports and statements on how unhealthy these are to your body and sleep have flooded us. However, though most of us are aware that they are both bad for our sleep, rarely are we fully knowledgeable about the "how."  So let us ask… How do caffeine and sugar affect our sleep? 
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's start with caffeine. <strong>Caffeine</strong> is an adenosine-receptor antagonist, meaning that it sits on adenosine receptors (hence the label "antagonist"). It primarily acts on A1 and A2A receptors, which are related to functions of the brian associated with sleep, arousal, and cognition. As an antagonist, caffeine prevents adenosine from binding, <strong>reducing feelings of sleepiness and fatigue</strong>. This is why many students consume energy drinks days while cramming for exams and most adults habitually drink coffee every morning. Once in our systems, caffeine is absorbed in the stomach and the small intestines. The absorption takes place quickly and efficiently, but it is highly dependent on the variable half-time. Variable half time means that different individuals take different lengths of time to break down caffeine. This is due to endogenous factors (relating to inside the body. E.g., genetics, liver enzymes, age, hormones) and exogenous factors (relating to outside the body. E.g., medications, smoking, sleep patterns). For example, the exogenous factor of nicotine use can increase metabolic speed of caffeine by as much as 50%.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, caffeine doesn't just make us focus better. It has <strong>residual impacts</strong> on us. It can take up to 20 hours (or equal to ⅘ half-lives_ for effects of caffeine tolerance to wear off, and side effects entail <strong>sleep deprivation</strong>, which brings the risk of poor performance. According to cross-sectional research conducted by Pecotic et al, those who consume more caffeine report having greater trouble staying awake. This may sound ironic, but caffeine may equally be a response to fatigue as a cause of it. Caffeine may contribute to sleep quality by impacting <strong>sleep pressure</strong>. Even low doses of caffeine have been found to reduce SWA at the beginning of the night for adults. This can impact the build-up of sleep pressure. Since caffeine takes some time to wear off, SWA is generally affected by both caffeine intake directly before sleep and also caffeine consumed in the morning of the same day (before sleep). Furthermore, the stimulant effects of caffeine can alter sleep continuity by reducing sleep efficiency and increasing sleep latency.

                In adolescents, the impact of caffeine is similar to that on adults. High caffeine intake is associated with an increase of reported <strong>sleep difficulties</strong>, sleep disturbances, and morning tiredness. Regular caffeine consumption in young subjects is also associated with <strong>later bedtimes and shorter sleep duration</strong>, factors connected to poor sleep. It also reduces SWA and alpha activity, which mean reduced sleep depth. Such reductions have been most strongly observed over the prefrontal, central, and occipital regions. Consistent with observations in adults, caffeine leads to <strong>SWA reduction</strong> mostly at the beginning of the night.

                Although not as often discussed as caffeine, there is evidence that consuming more <strong>sugar</strong> leads to more <strong>restless and disrupted sleep</strong>. As a result, it is equally important to learn the effect of sugar on sleep quality. A 2016 study found out that volunteers who consumed diets with more sugar took longer to fall asleep and spent less time in deep sleep (SWS), a crucial stage for the body's physical restoration and healing as well as for maintaining healthy metabolism and the immune function. These led to restless sleep and frequent awakenings throughout the night. Additionally, some sugary treats also contain caffeine, further interfering with rest.

                Eating sugar is pleasing and satisfying because it activates the brain's reward circuitry and complex web of hormones (that are related to hunger and metabolism). When we eat sugar, the brain releases dopamine, which in turn delivers powerful feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. Unfortunately, the more sugar we eat, the <strong>less sensitive</strong> our brains become to the dopamine rush. Consequently, to feel the same feeling of pleasure and satisfaction, we need to produce more dopamine. This often leads people to eat more sugar for that same pleasure.

                Sugary foods cause <strong>cravings</strong> while reducing the effectiveness of hunger-suppressing and metabolism-regulating hormones. Cravings typically lead to late-night eating and ultimately disrupt sleep; poor sleep worsens sugar cravings. Hence, an irregular sleep habit can create a cycle of disrupted sleep and <strong>overstimulated appetite</strong>, negatively affecting health weight gain, prediabetes, diabetes). Furthermore, poor sleep caused by sugar consumption can interfere with the normal production and function of hormones, including leptin, <strong>ghrelin</strong>, and insulin (Note: insulin is a hormone that acts as a key regulator of blood sugar).

                Both sleep and <strong>inflammation</strong> are regulated by circadian rhythms. Poor sleep increases chronic inflammation, which significantly contributes to disease. Similarly, systemic inflammation can also <strong>undermine healthy sleep</strong>. Diets high in sugar increase chronic inflammation. Sugar contributes to the formation of harmful biochemical components which foster inflammation. Sugar and refined carbohydrates also negatively impact gut bacteria by causing unhealthy, inflammation-boosting changes. This can pose a serious problem as gut bacteria are key regulators of overall health. Additionally, sugar <strong>elevates cholesterol</strong>, overall increasing inflammation.

                For those interested, here is some extra information on how inflammation worsens sleep in the first place. Inflammation comes with cytokines, which are chemical messengers that regulate sleep. More cytokines lead to sleep issues such as insomnia. Inflammation can also  create pain and stiffness in the body on its own, which collectively make good quality sleep difficult. Lastly, inflammation involves higher levels of cortisol, a hormone that stimulates alertness. This can lead to feelings of stress and cause poor sleep.
