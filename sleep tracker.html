                Now that you know more about sleep and the importance of good sleep quality, you need a <strong>tool to record your sleep</strong>. 
                A sleep diary is a convenient and useful way to track sleep at home. You should aim to record your sleep for at least 
                two weeks, and it's best if you <strong>complete it daily</strong>. The diary allows you to record when you went to bed, whether you 
                woke up during the night, and when you woke up in the morning. Ultimately, it can help you <strong>understand your sleep 
                pattern and improve it</strong>. If you notice a pattern, you can make one change at a time and maintain it that way for 
                around two weeks. Eventually, you will be able to maintain <strong>good sleep quality</strong>.

                The following sleep diary was specifically <strong>designed for teenagers</strong> and takes into account various factors that can hinder adolescents' sleep. 
                This includes when you exercised, whether you took a nap, and what time you had caffeine or excessve amounts of sugar. Factors like phone usage before bed, 
                have also been considered. You can <strong>print this pdf</strong> to record your sleep.
