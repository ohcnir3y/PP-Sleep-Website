                    <strong>Adolescence</strong> is a period in our lives when we change significantly, both physically and mentally. 
                    It marks the transition from childhood to adulthood and often shapes our character, defining who we are. 
                    We go through countless changes during this time (puberty), and these changes allow us to <strong>grow</strong>, arguably 
                    faster than we ever have or will. Similarly, sleep patterns also <strong>change</strong> throughout this period. These 
                    changes are caused by <strong>biological shifts in our body</strong> as well as our <strong>new lifestyles</strong>. As a result, it is 
                    very important to know about the specifics of adolescent sleep in order to understand the teen's body, habits, and health.

                <p>
                    Let's first delve into how teens' bodies <strong>change</strong> from a biological aspect. <strong>The delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD)</strong> is one of the most common problems in teens. Indeed, studies show that prevalence as high as 14% in the adolescent population. DSWPD can cause <strong>sleep deprivation</strong>, contributing to problems with focusing, mood swings, and low energy. Although the causes of this disorder are not clear, speculations have been made surrounding what plays a role. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Firstly, the <strong>circadian rhythm</strong> has been identified. The circadian rhythm tends to shift later during puberty. This is because the brain releases melatonin later in the evening than it would for a younger child or older adult. This can cause teens to sleep later than when they were younger. Secondly, <strong>genetics</strong> contribute to the development of the disorder. Research has found out that teens are more likely to develop the disorder if a parent had it. Thirdly, teens' <strong>social life</strong> can play a part. Many teens choose to stay up late and chat or hang out with friends. This can cause them to sleep later. Lastly, <strong>bright lights/blue light</strong> from electronic devices can negatively affect bedtime. Many teens use devices in the evening, and this can keep them awake past their ideal bedtime. Additionally, lack of exposure to bright light early in the morning can impact the circadian rhythm and lead to late bedtimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, teens are not the only ones that can be diagnosed with this disorder. Individuals working during night shifts, traveling across time zones, and consuming too much caffeine can also experience it. It is simply that it may be <strong>more common for teens</strong> to have these disorders due to biological shifts and habits. The problem becomes less prevalent as this population of teens age as teens' circadian rhythms shift earlier as they reach young adulthood.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To discuss the changes in circadian timing during puberty in detail, the <strong>circadian system</strong> is stabilized at around 6 months of age. It remains mostly unchanged until puberty. Once puberty starts, a natural delay in sleep phase is observed and teens stay up later at night and wake up later in the morning. Such intrinsic circadian changes, coupled with pubertal hormonal changes and increased light sensitivity can overall cause the <strong>delayed sleep phase</strong>. For example, during puberty, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (plays a big role in energy regulation and stress response) is affected. Some research has also provided evidence that teens are relatively sensitive to evening light.

                    Data shows that adolescents report <strong>going to bed later as they get older</strong>. Studies from multiple countries, including Canada, Poland, Belgium, Australia, Finland, and Brazil, show similar trends, verifying that this change is likely universal. Consistent reports have also been made on teenagers going to bed later on weekend nights than sleep nights. The difference for teenagers ranges from 1 to 2 hours, and data indicates the difference is often greater in older than younger teens. Factors associated have been identified to be the following: reduced parental influence on bedtimes, increased homework, extra-curricular activities (e.g., sports, musical groups, clubs, service groups, or part-time work), and other environmental and stimulating activities (e.g., watching TV, playing video games, and using the computer).
                </p>

                <p>
                    In particular, <strong>use of smart phones</strong> significantly affects teens' sleep. Currently, 25% of teenagers and young people are <strong>addicted</strong> to smartphones (Note: weight of this evidence is from South and East Asia; levels of smartphone addiction are often higher in Asian samples than Western populations, possibly due to cultural differences). Although this by itself is quite disturbing, more disturbing is that phone addiction is linked with <strong>poor sleep</strong>. Smartphones are portable, hand-held devices. Although convenient, such high portability means they have a higher potential of interrupting sleep quality and quantity. Addiction leads young individuals to use their device for longer periods while increasing the chances of them using the device nearer to their bedtimes. This means that almost one-forth of the young population may be gravely impacted by poor sleep caused by screen usage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Indeed, in various studies, problematic phone use has been consistently linked to <strong>poor sleep</strong>. Smartphone use has, in fact, been linked to daytime tiredness, sleep latency, and reduced sleep duration. When used close to sleep initiation, it can also delay the circadian rhythm and affect total sleep duration. Knowing or not knowing these negative effects of late phone usage, 72% of US teens report that they bring their phones into bedrooms and use them when going to bed. 28% leave phones while sleeping and report to have been awakened at night by texts, calls, or emails. 64% use electronic music devices, 23% play video games in the hour before sleep, and more than 50% text in the hour prior to sleep. Data reveals that these media using teens report poorer sleep and are less likely to feel refreshed in the morning. Exposure to lit screens at night worsens the sleep-phase delay. This happens because lit screens communicate through the retina to the portion of the brain that controls the circadian clock, telling that it is not nighttime yet. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>School demands</strong> also contribute to adolescents' late bedtime. Many adolescents complain about school logistics and high academic pressure. Many of these teens struggle with the lack of time and the need to balance working hours with free time. They also procrastinate and postpone the schoolwork tasks til evening, resulting in <strong>later sleeping hours</strong>. Some state that they can focus better in the evenings and choose to do homework at that time. Several studies have confirmed the association of school pressure with sleep onset difficulties. External academic expectations from parents, teachers, and society have been said to contribute to the pressure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Evidence from East Asian countries with competitive academic environments as well as an emphasis on academic achievements (Note: According to OECD PISA 2022, 15 year old adolescents from East Asian countries had best academic performance results and spent most time on homework among 81 countries) show that time spent on homework actually prevents adolescents from getting sufficient sleep. <strong>Intense academic stress and pressure</strong> can also lead to excessive worrying and ruminating, which lead to delayed sleep latency time. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, <strong>leisure time activities</strong> have been identified to lead to late bedtime. Adolescents mainly involve in two types of socializing activities: <strong>structured and unstructured</strong>. According to research, <strong>unorganized leisure time activities</strong> are reported to be time-consuming and are the main reason why adolescents postpone their homework and other leisure activities til the evening. For instance, online socialization with peers, a popular, unstructured leisure time activity among adolescents often leads teens to sacrifice sleep to connect with friends. Similar unstructured activities such as hanging out, meeting friends, and social networking have been associated with sleep onset difficulties, poorer sleep quality, and insufficient sleep in teens.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, participation in <strong>organized leisure time activities</strong> is associated with lower levels of school stress, better academic achievement, well-being, and less problematic screen usage. It also builds supportive social networks and develops goal-oriented and self-control skills, which are skills linked with prioritization of sleep and good time management. Overall, it indirectly influences quality of sleep, improving it significantly while enhancing perceived school experience. As a result, adolescents are highly encouraged to participate in these activities.

                    Recommendations that use the modified RAND Appropriateness Method suggest that teens 13-18 of age should sleep <strong>8-10 hours per 24 hours</strong> on a regular basis to promote optimal health. However, many recent studies reveal that teens are not getting as much sleep and that sleep deprivation is a pervasive problem. 75% of preadolescents and 45% of late adolescents exhibit sleep problems, with up to 70% of US teens regularly sleeping less than 8 hours. Adolescents frequently report receiving insufficient sleep. In fact, only 15% percent reported sleeping 8.5 or more hours on school nights, whereas 26% reported sleeping 6.5 hours or less. But these teens need just as much sleep as preteens, and their <strong>optimal</strong> sleep duration is 9 hours a night. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Country-specific studies have revealed that the lack of sleep, though common around the world, differs in severity in different areas. In the US, high school seniors sleep on average 6.9 hours a night, contrasting to the average of 8.4 hours of sleep 6th graders get. South Korean teens sleep for a shockingly short period of time, sleeping on average 4.9 hours a night. This may be attributed to early school beginning times (between 7 and 8:30am) and additional evening classes many students take in Korea. Researchers attribute such deprived hours of sleep as a cause of Korea's relatively high suicide rates, linking chronic sleep deprivation to suicide. Australian teens sleep the best among these mentioned countries. Their teens sleep on average 9 hours a night, which fits in the range of recommended hours of daily sleep. Their sufficient sleep may possibly be because school usually starts later in Australia.

                    Sleep deprivation and late bedtimes are, of course, big problems in teens' sleep. However, there are other problems that are widely observed in the adolescent population. One of the most problematic ones is <strong>sleep debt</strong>. Most teens follow a pattern of sleeping less during the week and sleeping in on weekends to compensate. Though many believe this helps reverse the effects of lack of sleep during the week, research proves it clearly doesn't. Firstly, many teens <strong>do not sufficiently recover</strong> in the weekend and end up fatigued in the following week again. Additionally, shifting patterns on the weekends such as late nights with friends followed by late mornings in bed do not match the weekday rhythm, creating what Carskadon refers to as the <strong>"social jet lag."</strong>
